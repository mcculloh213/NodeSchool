# NodeSchool
## Install Core `NodeSchool/install-core.sh`
This is an executable shell script that will install the core workshops from [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io). It will prompt the user for their password because it uses `sudo` to run the install due to `npm` requiring administrative permissions. With that being said, `nodejs` and `npm` must be installed as well, which is not handled in this script, but will be handled in another.
